# Configurations for dynamic ui generation. Effect options can be changed by widgets created at runtime,
# meaning that you don't need to worry about the user interface - it's all done for you. All you need to
# do is add items to this dict below.
#
# First line of code below explained (as an example):
#   "Energy" is the visualization we're doing options for
#   "blur" is the key in the options dict (config.settings["devices"][self.board]["effect_opts"]["Energy"]["blur"])
#   "Blur" is the string we show on the GUI next to the slider
#   "float_slider" is the GUI element we want to use
#   (0.1,4.0,0.1) is a tuple containing all the details for setting up the slider (see above)
#
# Each effect key points to a list. Each list contains lists giving config for each option.
# Syntax: effect:[key, label_text, ui_element, opts]
#   effect     - the effect which you want to change options for. MUST have a key in config.settings["devices"][board]["effect_opts"]
#   key        - the key of thing you want to be changed. MUST be in config.settings["devices"][board]["effect_opts"][effect], otherwise it won't work.
#   label      - the text displayed on the ui
#   ui_element - how you want the variable to be changed
#   opts       - options for the ui element. check below for what each ui element needs.
# UI Elements + opts:
#   slider, (min, max, interval)                   (for integer values in a given range)
#   float_slider, (min, max, interval)             (for floating point values in a given range)
#   checkbox, *leave blank*                        (for True/False values)
#   dropdown, (dict, list, "colours"/"gradients")  (dict/list, example see below. Keys will be displayed in the dropdown if dict, otherwise just list items. "colours" or "gradients" will handle colour/grad selection for you
#
# Hope this clears things up a bit for you! GUI has never been easier..? The reason for doing this is
# 1 - To make it easy to add options to your effects for the user
# 2 - To give a consistent GUI for the user. If every options page was set out differently it would all be a mess

    ~~ NOTES ~~
[use_defaults]
For any dicts in this file (config.py), you can add them into the use_defaults
dict to force the program to use these values over any stored in settings.ini
that you would have set using the GUI. At runtime, settings.ini is used to update
the above dicts with custom set values. 
If you're running a headless RPi, you may want to edit settings in this file, then
specify to use the dict you wrote, rather than have the program overwrite from 
settings.ini at runtime. You could also run the program with the gui, set the 
settings that you want, then disable the gui and the custom settings will still
be loaded. Basically it works as you would expect it to.
[DEVICE TYPE]
Device used to control LED strip.
'ESP8266' means that you are using an ESP8266 module to control the LED strip
and commands will be sent to the ESP8266 over WiFi. You can have as many of 
these as your computer is able to handle.
'RaspberryPi' means that you are using a Raspberry Pi as a standalone unit to process
audio input and control the LED strip directly.
'BlinkStick' means that a BlinkstickPro is connected to this PC which will be used
to control the leds connected to it.
'Fadecandy' means that a Fadecandy server is running on your computer and is connected
via usb to a Fadecandy board connected to LEDs
'DotStar' creates an APA102-based output device. LMK if you have any success 
getting this to work becuase i have no clue if it will.
'Stripless' means that the program will run without sending data to a strip.
Useful for development etc, but doesn't look half as good ;)
[REQUIRED CONFIGURATION KEYS]
===== 'ESP8266'
 "AUTO_DETECT"            # Set this true if you're using windows hotspot to connect (see below for more info)
 "MAC_ADDR"               # MAC address of the ESP8266. Only used if AUTO_DETECT is True
 "UDP_IP"                 # IP address of the ESP8266. Must match IP in ws2812_controller.ino
 "UDP_PORT"               # Port number used for socket communication between Python and ESP8266
===== 'RaspberryPi'
 "LED_PIN"                # GPIO pin connected to the LED strip pixels (must support PWM)
 "LED_FREQ_HZ"            # LED signal frequency in Hz (usually 800kHz)
 "LED_DMA"                # DMA channel used for generating PWM signal (try 5)
 "BRIGHTNESS"             # Brightness of LED strip between 0 and 255
 "LED_INVERT"             # Set True if using an inverting logic level converter
===== 'BlinkStick'
 No required configuration keys
===== 'Fadecandy'
 "SERVER"                 # Address of Fadecandy server. (usually 'localhost:7890')
===== 'DotStar'
 No required configuration keys
===== 'Stripless'
 No required configuration keys (heh)
[AUTO_DETECT]
Set to true if the ip address of the device changes. This is the case if it's connecting
through windows hotspot, for instance. If so, give the mac address of the device. This 
allows windows to look for the device's IP using "arp -a" and finding the matching
mac address. I haven't tested this on Linux or macOS.
[FPS]
FPS indicates the desired refresh rate, or frames-per-second, of the audio
visualization. The actual refresh rate may be lower if the computer cannot keep
up with desired FPS value.
Higher framerates improve "responsiveness" and reduce the latency of the
visualization but are more computationally expensive.
Low framerates are less computationally expensive, but the visualization may
appear "sluggish" or out of sync with the audio being played if it is too low.
The FPS should not exceed the maximum refresh rate of the LED strip, which
depends on how long the LED strip is.
[N_FFT_BINS]
Fast Fourier transforms are used to transform time-domain audio data to the
frequency domain. The frequencies present in the audio signal are assigned
to their respective frequency bins. This value indicates the number of
frequency bins to use.
A small number of bins reduces the frequency resolution of the visualization
but improves amplitude resolution. The opposite is true when using a large
number of bins. More bins is not always better!
There is no point using more bins than there are pixels on the LED strip.
